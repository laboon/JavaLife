# Deliverable 4

### Run the Tests

- Gradle is capable of running out-of-the-box here via:

```bash
gradle test
```

- Should this fail, you may also have success by running:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### View the Test Results

The results of our tests as XMLs are at:
`/build/test-results/*.xml`

The results of our tests as an HTML is at:
`/build/reports/tests/index.html`

### View source files

Unfortunately due to the project structure of Gradle, you can find your source files refactored under:
`/src/main/java`

### View other files

Anything else should be attached to the print-out or in the PDF. This and all other files can be found at:
`/misc`
